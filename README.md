## Welcome to the Be Focused repository!

This repository serves as a demonstration of a Flutter mobile application for both iOS and Android platforms.

This project emphasizes the implementation of various architectural patterns and best practices commonly used in Flutter
app development.

### Key Features:

1. **State Management**: The application utilizes the Bloc library for efficient state management, allowing for clear
   separation of business logic from UI components.

2. **Dependency Injection**: Dependency injection is implemented using GetIt combined with the Injectable package,
   enabling easier management of dependencies and better code organization.

3. **Navigation**: The application uses AutoRoute is employed for navigation within the app, providing a convenient and
   type-safe way to handle routing between different screens.

4. **Data Storage**: Data storage is handled using Firebase Firestore, offering a scalable and real-time database
   solution for storing and synchronizing app data across devices.

5. **Architecture**: The project follows Clean Architecture principles to ensure a modular, scalable, and maintainable
   codebase. By separating concerns into layers such as domain, data, and presentation, the application achieves
   improved flexibility.
